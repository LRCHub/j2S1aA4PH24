He's putting on his make up
It's the top of the line
Making sure they'll never see it
When he cries

Because every day
Is the end of his life
When he's eighteen
He'll leave town

His only friends are girls
But never date him
And every guy he knows
They all degrade him

And every time he tries
They'll never recognize
That the green brings out his eyes

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

Only two months left
Until he gets out of hell
Counting seconds
Until he hears that final bell

While all the other girls
Are shopping for the prom
He's at home with his lips on

Then Stefani asks, "Will you go with me"
"To the dance? I know you will eclipse me"
At the end of the day, he even said okay
Only if he can wear the tiara

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

He's the prom queen
And it's no disguise
He's the prom queen
And it's no disguise
He's the prom queen

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

Show 'em you're bored
Get on that train
Close your eyes
Never look back again

He's the prom queen
And it's no disguise

I’ve been thinking about the way you hold me lately
On a bus, my head, nearMissouri
All the things we done, don’t matter much if at all
It’s over now
Would you hustle, would you break me off some
bread
Maybe I’ll just get baked here in bed
Remember all the cradling and touching
It’s always the same
This will be our last prom
All your little love songs
All the time we spent in the Dollar General
(I would love you for always)
Picking out the gifts for your little niece
(I know that she’ll love it)
I wonder if they got the wrong opinion
(a picture lasts longer)
The way they looking at me
This will be our last prom
All your little love songs
This will be our last prom
Full of nothing but silly little love songs
I promise
no matter what we did, in the past,
what you think of, your opinions
I promise, from now, I’ll be true
But if you don’t trust me girl, that’s ok, I understand
It’s been a really long road
We’ve had our ups and downs
So do me this last favor
Me and you
One last prom
Just for me and you
One last prom
I’m ready for you out of that bed
I’m showing them Chad's some static
I’m noticing a ‘10’ to the right,
but i’d rather trade up in attics
I burn the needle down the red
tryin’ to find my credit some debit
when I wake you’re Socratic
sold the world, took it back, you’re at it Oba
chopped up insisted implied,
i’m on the 10 clicks on a side
seven 38’s, heard ‘em say your name
up in the bitch debates!!

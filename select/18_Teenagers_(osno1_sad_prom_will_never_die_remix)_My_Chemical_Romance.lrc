[00:00.55] They're gonna clean up your looks
[00:02.35] With all the lies in the books
[00:04.59] To make a citizen out of you
[00:09.05] Because they sleep with a gun
[00:11.11] And keep an eye on you, son
[00:13.59] So they can watch all the things you do
[00:33.09] 
[00:17.75] Because the drugs never work
[00:20.12] They're gonna give you a smirk
[00:22.32] 'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
[00:26.44] They're gonna rip up your heads
[00:28.98] Your aspirations to shreds
[00:31.14] Another cog in the murder machine
[00:47.64] 
[00:34.68] They said, "All teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me"
[00:40.04] They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
[00:44.44] So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
[00:48.59] Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
[01:09.09] 
[00:52.09] The boys and girls in the clique
[00:54.75] The awful names that they stick
[00:57.14] You're never gonna fit in much, kid
[01:01.11] But if you're troubled and hurt
[01:03.63] What you got under your shirt
[01:05.96] Will make them pay for the things that they did
[01:29.46] 
[01:09.45] They said, "All teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me"
[01:14.75] They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
[01:19.10] So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
[01:22.86] Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
[01:43.36] 
[01:26.40] Oh, yeah!
[01:30.90] 
[01:43.39] They said, "All teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me"
[01:48.76] They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
[01:52.88] So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
[01:56.97] Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
[02:17.47] 
[02:00.02] All together now!
[02:01.82] "Teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me"
[02:05.67] They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
[02:09.76] So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
[02:13.64] Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
[02:34.14] 
[02:18.06] "Teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me"
[02:22.61] They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
[02:26.76] So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
[02:30.58] Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
